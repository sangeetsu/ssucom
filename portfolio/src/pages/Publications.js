      title: "GAN-Based Domain Adaptation & Randomization for Creating Digital Twins of Small-Scale Driving Testbeds",
      authors: "SS Ulhas, S Kannapiran, S Berman",
      conference: "IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Vehicles (IV)",
      year: "2024",
      abstract: "This paper presents a novel approach to creating digital twins of small-scale driving testbeds using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for domain adaptation and randomization. The method bridges the gap between simulation and reality, enabling more effective testing and development of autonomous vehicle systems.",

      conference: "IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine (RAM)",
      year: "2024",
      abstract: "This comprehensive survey reviews the state-of-the-art in small-scale testbeds for connected and automated vehicles and robot swarms. It categorizes existing testbeds, discusses their advantages and limitations, and provides insights into future research directions in this field.",

      conference: "IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)",
      year: "2022",
      abstract: "This paper introduces CHARTOPOLIS, a multi-faceted sociotechnical testbed designed to aid in building connections among engineers, psychologists, anthropologists, ethicists, and artists. It serves as an urban autonomous-vehicle testbed that includes both a physical environment for small-scale robotic vehicles and a high-fidelity virtual replica.",
